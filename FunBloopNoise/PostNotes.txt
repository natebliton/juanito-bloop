Here's a shockingly fun module. I built it originally for Casiotone-style "beep" percussion noises, but with FM and a snappy way to make the beeps longer, the noises it can make are really expressive. I seem to pull this module into my jamming much more often than it seems to deserve with how simple it is.
You could simplify it by removing the output buffer and taking the signal straight from the potentiometer. It wouldn't need a bipolar supply in that case!
Old-school 555 chips don't need the 10n capacitor on pin 5, but fancy modern CMOS 555 chips might.

Nice! Two of my favourite ICs for noise toys.
Probably a good idea to tie the unused inputs on the CD4046 to gnd, though.

you're probably right. It's been a while since I examined the datasheet, not sure which pins are inputs...

Does the 150 ohm resistor keep the 555 from syncing with the 4046?

I do that in all my designs that use 555 chips, especially the original ones. They're notoriously unkind to power rails - PAiA even passed power through an LED to isolate the chip from the rest of the circuitry. That's why there's the power resistor combined with the 100uF capacitor.
If you use more modern 555 timer chips (TLC555, 7555, LSC555 there's *lots*), they won't need the resistor or the oversized capacitor.
