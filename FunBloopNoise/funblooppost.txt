Here's a shockingly fun module. I built it originally for Casiotone-style "beep" percussion noises, but with FM and a snappy way to make the beeps longer, the noises it can make are really expressive. I seem to pull this module into my jamming much more often than it seems to deserve with how simple it is.
You could simplify it by removing the output buffer and taking the signal straight from the potentiometer. It wouldn't need a bipolar supply in that case!
Old-school 555 chips don't need the 10n capacitor on pin 5, but fancy modern CMOS 555 chips might.
